            <p class="content-text">
                On June 11, 2025, students from the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) program of Western Mindanao State University's College of Computing Studies (WMSU CCS) visited the Asian Development Bank (ADB) headquarters in Mandaluyong City. This meaningful industry exposure was made possible through the efforts of CXC and IBPAP (IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines)—key partners in bridging the gap between the academe and the global workforce.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The visit began with a guided tour of the ADB Library and ADB History Gallery, providing students with a deeper appreciation of ADB's decades-long commitment to sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific. The students were then ushered into the ADB Function Hall, where the main program took place—setting a formal tone for what would be a day filled with insight, inspiration, and real-world learning.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The program opened with an overview of ADB's mission and operations. Students learned how the bank supports regional growth through infrastructure financing, technical assistance, and inclusive economic development programs. Representatives from CXC followed with a presentation introducing their role in global workforce solutions. They discussed how they assist businesses in managing contingent talent through services like compliance, payroll management, and talent sourcing in both local and international contexts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                One of the key highlights of the day was a Fireside Chat with ADB's Infrastructure and Technology Division (ITD). Students engaged directly with directors from Infrastructure Services (IS) and Network Services (NS), who shared their personal career stories and explained the critical role of IT in multilateral institutions. The conversation offered practical guidance on navigating careers in tech—especially within global, mission-driven organizations. Students were highly engaged during the Q&A session, where they asked questions about technical skills, career preparation, and international work culture.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Adding to the experience, WMSU CCS students were given the opportunity to present one of their featured Software Engineering projects: RePay, a fintech application aimed at providing ethical micro-lending services to underserved communities. The app, which offers flexible repayment options and transparent processes, impressed the ADB professionals, sparking dialogue on the role of digital finance in sustainable development.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Later in the session, ADB shared an internal presentation titled "IT at ADB", which showcased their digital transformation initiatives. Through real-world case studies, students saw how technology is being used to tackle large-scale development challenges in the region. The session introduced students to the ADB Future IT Leaders Graduate Program, a career track that offers structured mentorship, professional growth, and opportunities to contribute to global development goals through technology.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The students then explored the ADB workspace through a guided facility tour, giving them a closer look at how one of Asia's top development institutions operates on a day-to-day basis. A representative from ADB's Corporate Services Department (CSD) spoke about the organization's inclusive culture, support systems, and strong commitment to employee development.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The visit concluded with a networking session, where students connected with ADB and CXC professionals in a relaxed environment. Closing remarks from WMSU and partner representatives capped the day, expressing mutual gratitude for the learning opportunity and commitment to continued collaboration.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                This immersive visit to ADB provided WMSU BSCS students with a unique lens into the intersection of technology, development, and international collaboration. It was more than just a company tour—it was a chance to reflect on how tech skills can be applied for meaningful, global impact.

            <h2 class="content-title">My Visit to MicroSourcing: Lessons on Growth, Culture, and Career Possibilities in Tech</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                On June 11, 2025, our journey as BSCS students from WMSU's College of Computing Studies took us to MicroSourcing's headquarters at Global One Center, Eastwood, Quezon City. This industry visit was part of our immersion program aimed at giving us firsthand insight into how tech companies operate—and more importantly, how we might fit into them someday.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The session started with a warm welcome from Ms. Heidee Enriquez, CEO of MicroSourcing and Beepo. Her message was genuinely inspiring. She talked about how today's tech industry isn't just looking for skills—it values people who are curious, adaptable, and committed to continuous learning. One thing she said really stuck with me: "Being a lifelong learner is part of the journey." It reminded me that graduation is not the finish line—it's just the beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                We also learned about MicroSourcing's background as one of the country's pioneers in outsourcing solutions. Their inclusive work culture, flexible work setups, and dedication to upskilling their employees really impressed me. During the facility tour, we got to see their modern office spaces and collaborative work environments. The design wasn't just aesthetic—it was clearly built to support both productivity and employee well-being.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                One of my favorite parts was the LinkedIn Workshop. It was a very practical session where we were taught how to build a standout professional profile, network with recruiters, and showcase our strengths online. With the rise of remote work and digital hiring, this session felt extremely relevant. It also gave me clarity on how I want to shape my digital footprint moving forward.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Toward the end, we had an open forum with MicroSourcing's team, which allowed us to ask honest questions about career paths, expectations, and how to transition smoothly from school to work life. We also heard powerful words from other professionals like Atty. Joey, Mikel, and Aira. A few quotes I took to heart:
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                "Don't change your dreams—change your opportunities." – Atty. Joey<br><br>
                "Situational modification is part of learning." – Mikel<br><br>
                "Communication develops over time. As early as now, we need to work on our competencies." – Aira
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                This visit gave me more than just knowledge—it gave me direction. It helped me understand the kind of workplace I want to be part of, the skills I still need to work on, and the mindset I should keep as I move forward. I'm grateful to MicroSourcing, IBPAP, and WMSU CCS for this opportunity. Experiences like this make me even more excited to step into the tech industry—not just as a programmer, but as a lifelong learner ready to grow.
