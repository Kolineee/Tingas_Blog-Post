                This blog captures one of the most unforgettable experiences of my journey as a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) student from Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). It documents our Industrial Visit a vital part of our Work Immersion program, designed to help us connect classroom learning with real world industry practices.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                From June 9 to June 14, 2025, we were given the opportunity to visit leading tech and IT BPM companies in Metro Manila. These experiences allowed us to explore the professional world we aim to be part of in the future. After completing our company visits, we also had the chance to relax and enjoy scenic spots in Tagaytay and Baguio City a well deserved reward after all the hard work we've done as students.
