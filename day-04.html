            <h2 class="content-title">Day 4 in Tagaytay: A Well Earned Break Above the Clouds</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                After completing all our company visits, June 12, 2025, gave us the perfect opportunity to unwind. We were done visiting industry giants, learning from experts, and absorbing real world insights now it was time to enjoy. And for me, it was extra special because it was my first time visiting Tagaytay.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                We began our day at the iconic People's Park in the Sky. Located at the highest point of Tagaytay, this place literally felt like we were walking through clouds. The chilly breeze, foggy air, and breathtaking views made it feel like we were in another world. Looking down from above, we could see vast greenery and treetops stretching out to the horizon. It was peaceful, refreshing, and a perfect break from the busy days we'd just come from.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Next, we visited SkyRanch and here's where things got wild. While I've been on rides before, I've never tried anything extreme. But since I was surrounded by not just classmates, but real friends, I gathered enough courage to try something new. They encouraged me, and I didn't want to be a killjoy. I figured, "I'm getting older, might as well experience it now."
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                So I rode the Super Vikings, a giant swinging boat and I instantly regretted it. Every time the boat reached its peak, my feet would lift off the ground. It felt like I was going to fall. I screamed, then stopped screaming because I was too dizzy. I closed my eyes most of the time, and when I opened them, I could only see clouds. The fear was real. And yes I vomited after the ride and felt super dizzy (nahihilo talaga ako). I sat down, trying to recover while laughing at myself. That ride truly wasn't for me but now I have a story I'll never forget.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Even with that unforgettable (and dizzying) moment, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. What made it all worthwhile was the people around me their support, laughter, and energy made everything better. We were more than just students on a field trip; we were a group of friends creating memories, facing fears, and celebrating the journey we've been on.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Tagaytay gave us the pause we needed and reminded me that sometimes, the best moments happen when you step out of your comfort zone (even if it means throwing up after).
