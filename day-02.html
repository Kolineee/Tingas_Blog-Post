            <p class="content-text">
                On the morning of June 10, 2025, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) students from Western Mindanao State University (WMSU) continued their industry immersion with a visit to the dynamic headquarters of Teleperformance (TP) Philippines, located at SM Aura in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), Taguig. This visit offered students an in-depth view of one of the world's leading providers of digitally integrated business services. The session was graciously hosted by Ms. Beatrice Grace Bonjibod, Brand Marketing Specialist at Teleperformance Philippines, who welcomed the students with energy and enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                In her engaging presentation, Ms. Bonjibod provided an overview of Teleperformance as a global force not only in customer service but also in digital transformation. She emphasized that TP's work goes far beyond voice-based support, covering a wide range of tech-enabled services that blend automation, data, and human insight. One of the most inspiring highlights was the company's strong advocacy for diversity and inclusivity—with 53% of their workforce made up of women, a reflection of TP's commitment to gender equality and empowering talent from all backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Ms. Bonjibod also stressed the increasing importance of soft skills in the tech and service sectors. Communication, empathy, adaptability, and teamwork, she explained, are just as valuable as technical knowledge in creating successful professionals. After the talk, students toured the Innovation and Solutions Hub, where they saw how Teleperformance uses automation, analytics, and digital platforms to solve real-world problems and deliver smarter, faster customer experiences. This hands-on exposure gave students valuable insight into how emerging technologies are shaping modern business operations.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                To wrap up the visit, students engaged in an interactive session with TP's Human Resources team. They learned more about the company's recruitment processes, internship opportunities, and workplace culture. Some students even participated in mock interviews, receiving feedback that will serve them well in future job applications. Before heading out, they received thoughtful schwag items from the IT & Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP)—a small but meaningful reminder of the opportunities that lie ahead in the IT-BPM industry.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Overall, the Teleperformance visit was both insightful and inspiring. It opened students' eyes to the importance of inclusivity, innovation, and industry readiness. The WMSU College of Computing Studies continues to provide meaningful real-world exposure through experiences like this, equipping students not only with technical knowledge but with the mindset and skills needed to thrive in today's evolving digital landscape.

                On the afternoon of June 10, 2025, BSCS students from the College of Computing Studies (CCS) of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU) had the opportunity to visit Kollab, a forward-thinking tech company located at Greenfield Tower, Mandaluyong City. The visit was part of the students' multi-day industry immersion program, giving them direct exposure to innovation-driven companies operating at the forefront of artificial intelligence, software development, and collaborative technology.

            <p class="content-text">
                This was followed by an inspiring talk from Jazmine Calma, Senior Engineer for Quality Assurance, who spoke on the topic "Why Culture Matters." She underscored the importance of nurturing a positive workplace culture and explained how an inclusive, values-driven environment can directly impact product quality and team success. Her talk encouraged students to consider culture as a critical factor when choosing or building their future workplaces in tech.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Up next was Toni-Jan Keith Monserrat, Senior Principal Engineer for AI and Data, who delivered a thought-provoking presentation titled "Applied AI: From Classroom to Real Use Cases." Monserrat shared concrete examples of how artificial intelligence is transforming industries—from agriculture to healthcare—and how these innovations are grounded in the very concepts students learn in class. His talk sparked excitement among students, encouraging them to envision how their classroom skills could drive positive change in society.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The session continued with Miguel Siriban, UI/UX Designer and UI Developer at Kollab, who led a practical and engaging discussion on "How to Build a Dev Portfolio that Gets You Hired." He gave students actionable advice on showcasing projects, presenting clean and effective design, and demonstrating both technical knowledge and personal style in portfolios—key ingredients for attracting employers in a competitive tech market.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The visit concluded with a panel discussion and open forum, where the students engaged Kollab's team with questions about transitioning from college to careers, tips for standing out during job applications, and strategies for continuous learning. The speakers shared their personal journeys and encouraged students to stay curious, confident, and adaptable in the ever-evolving tech industry.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Before wrapping up, the group enjoyed light refreshments and informal networking, allowing students to connect with Kollab professionals in a relaxed setting. A group photo marked the end of the visit, capturing what was truly a memorable and inspiring experience.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                This visit to Kollab offered much more than a look inside a tech office—it gave WMSU CCS students a real taste of industry culture, practical career guidance, and the motivation to pursue careers grounded in innovation, empathy, and purpose. The university extends its heartfelt thanks to Kollab for generously sharing their time, stories, and expertise with the next generation of computing professionals.
