            <p class="content-text">
                Last June 9 in the morning, we had the opportunity to visit Foundever PH, the very first company in our industry tour itinerary. From the moment we arrived, the staff welcomed us with warmth and hospitality. It was clear they had really prepared for our visit. Their team made us feel comfortable and appreciated, which helped set the tone for a meaningful and inspiring experience. We listened to several speakers who shared their personal journeys—how they started, the challenges they faced, and how they became who they are today. Their stories were not only inspiring but also motivating for us as computer science students beginning to explore the tech world.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The staff gave us a tour of some parts of the company, and we immediately noticed the positive and professional atmosphere. Everyone we encountered was friendly, and it was evident that Foundever is a place where collaboration and growth are encouraged. Formerly known as Sitel Group®, Foundever is a global leader in customer experience (CX) solutions, providing services in more than 45 languages for various industries. They use modern technologies like AI, cloud computing, and data analytics to help global brands deliver excellent digital customer service.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                During our visit, we had interactive discussions with the operations and IT teams. These sessions gave us valuable insights into how the company runs large-scale support services. We learned about important topics such as digital transformation, cybersecurity, agile methodology, and data privacy—concepts we study in class, but now saw being applied in real-world scenarios. The team showed us that working in the IT-BPM sector involves more than just technical skills—it's also about problem-solving, innovation, and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The visit was made even more special by a talk from Ms. Zoe Diaz De Rivera, a representative from IBPAP (IT & Business Process Association of the Philippines). She provided an informative overview of the IT-BPM industry in the Philippines, which currently employs over 1.7 million Filipinos. She discussed how the sector continues to grow through new technologies like automation, AI, and robotic process automation (RPA). Additionally, the IBPAP speaker highlighted that the industry is not only looking for technical skills but also values communication, critical thinking, and adaptability. They encouraged us to build strong digital portfolios and take advantage of internship opportunities to become industry-ready.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                As the visit came to an end, we exchanged tokens of appreciation and had a quick photo session with the Foundever team. This activity was more than just a tour—it was an eye-opening experience that connected what we've learned in the classroom with what's happening in the real world. Foundever and IBPAP helped us see the broader opportunities in tech and reminded us that the future is full of possibilities. Through this kind of exposure, the WMSU College of Computing Studies continues to support its mission of preparing us—its students—to become competent and future-ready professionals in the digital age.

            <h2 class="content-title">WMSU BSCS Students Visit Google Philippines: A Creative and Inspiring Glimpse into Tech Culture</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                In the afternoon of June 9, BSCS students from Western Mindanao State University (WMSU) continued their first day of industry immersion with an exciting and eye-opening visit to Google Philippines, located at Bonifacio Global City (BGC) in Taguig. From the moment we stepped into their lobby, we were amazed by the artistic and culturally rich environment. Every design element had a story to tell. One of the highlights was a large wall illustration originally created by the iconic Filipino cartoonist Larry Alcala, which was redrawn by his grandchild. The artwork, known for its playful hidden characters, invites viewers to look closely—almost like a game where you need to find elements to complete the scene. Another standout piece was the uniquely designed chair called "Anak ng Tupa," crafted by William, which also carried a special meaning that added to the depth and creativity of the space.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The visit was hosted by Atty. Yves Gonzalez, Head of Government Affairs and Public Policy at Google Philippines. He warmly welcomed us and shared his inspiring personal journey—from studying to become an attorney to eventually following his passion for technology. At Google, he found a fulfilling career where law, tech, and public service align. He spoke about the company's unique work culture, where there is both freedom and responsibility. "Dadagdag ang trabaho mo o lalalim ka," he said, meaning you have the choice to either expand your tasks or deepen your role. He also shared how Google truly takes care of its employees—with free food, free internet, and a supportive environment that values growth, wellness, and impact.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Atty. Gonzalez also gave us a deeper understanding of how Google decides which projects succeed or end. He explained that user adoption is the number one factor. At Google, they are not afraid to launch new products—or unlaunch them if they don't gain traction. This openness to experimentation and data-driven decisions was a valuable lesson for us future developers. He also touched on Google's use of AI in services like Search and Translate, as well as the company's initiatives in digital inclusion, public-private partnerships, and ethical tech governance.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                After the talk, we were given a guided tour of the Google PH office. It reflected the company's culture perfectly—bright, open, creative, and collaborative. From themed meeting rooms to cozy lounges and collaborative workspaces, every part of the office was designed to inspire. It was our first time inside a global tech company's office, and the experience sparked both curiosity and excitement for the kind of careers we might pursue one day.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The Google PH visit left a lasting impact on us. It helped us understand how technology, creativity, public policy, and purpose can come together in a real-world career. For many of us, it expanded our vision of what we could be—not just coders, but innovators who can shape the future. Through this experience, the WMSU College of Computing Studies continues to fulfill its mission of preparing students to become competent, socially responsible, and globally competitive tech professionals.
