            <p class="content-text">
                June 13 to 14, 2025. After all the company visits, technical talks, and learning filled days, it was finally time to reward ourselves. As part of our itinerary, we set out on an unforgettable journey to Baguio City, often called the <strong>"Summer Capital of the Philippines"</strong> and rightfully so. With its cool climate, pine scented air, scenic mountain views, and vibrant cultural charm, Baguio truly lives up to its titles the <strong>City of Pines</strong> and a haven away from the tropical heat.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                This part of our trip felt like a well earned pause not the end of our journey as Computer Science students, but a beautiful stop along the way. A reward not just from our school, but from our parents and everyone who has supported us in this journey. These memories are the ones we'll keep close to our hearts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                We left Manila at 1:00 AM, traveling by bus with our cheerful and super informative tour guide, Ate Veron, and our ever supportive teachers, Sir Salimar and Sir JLo. By around 5:30 AM, we arrived at Baguio Strawberry Farm. At first, I didn't realize where we were maybe because I was still half asleep and looking for the nearest CR. But the moment I stepped out of the bus, I was hit by that sharp, refreshing cold air. It wasn't like aircon or an electric fan it was real, natural cold. That's when it hit me: <em>"we're finally in Baguio."</em>
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                At the farm, we bought pasalubong like strawberry jam, handmade bags, keychains, and more. I also tried Baguio's strawberry taho, and wow it was so good! It really had actual strawberry bits in it and was a must try.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Next, we visited the Bell Church, a Taoist temple filled with peaceful vibes and beautiful architecture. While we have a Bell Church in Zamboanga, this one was bigger, more spacious, and surrounded by scenic views. I was especially amazed at how the houses and buildings in Baguio were built on hills and slopes something you don't see every day.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                We then headed to our hotel to freshen up and have breakfast. I found it fascinating that our hotel didn't even need air conditioning Baguio's natural cool air was more than enough. After resting and lunch, we visited the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) the country's premier military school. The view was stunning, with mountains in the background. We saw old, preserved aircrafts and learned about the history and significance of the statues there. The whole place was clean, peaceful, and filled with a sense of honor.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                From there, we made a quick stop at The Mansion, the official summer residence of the Philippine President. We didn't stay long but made sure to take a group photo before moving on to our final destination for the day: Mines View Park. This place was a favorite! You could wear traditional Igorot attire, ride a pink colored horse, shop for souvenirs, and even make a wish by throwing coins into a target that leads into water. It wasn't just fun it was meaningful.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                That night, after dinner, we were given free time, so we explored more. With my friends, we went to Burnham Park and rode a boat together under the night sky. Afterward, we went on a mini food trip. I even tried Tanghulu a sugar coated fruit snack for the very first time. It's a simple moment, but trying it in Baguio made it even more special. We ended the night walking around, talking, and just enjoying each other's company.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The next morning, before heading back to Manila, we had one last round of free time. After breakfast, we visited a cozy coffee shop, just chilling and enjoying the peaceful vibe. Then, we returned to Burnham Park to ride bikes. I got to try the cart style bike, which was fun but I realized I preferred the regular two wheel ones <em>(they look cooler, honestly)</em>. Finally, we went to SM Baguio, which surprised me with its beautiful open air structure and amazing view of the city below.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Baguio wasn't just another destination it was <strong>a memory in motion</strong>. <strong>A reward. A pause. A breath of fresh, pine scented air in the middle of our student lives.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                And although we may not be done yet with our academic journey, this trip reminded me that <em>there's beauty in every step whether it's learning in a tech company or laughing with friends in the cold fog of Baguio.</em>
